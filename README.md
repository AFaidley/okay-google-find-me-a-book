## Technology Used

- GraphQL
- React

## Installation
The user would need to install Node, the following link describes how to do so: https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/how-to-install-nodejs <br> After installing Node they will then have to install the required packages and they can do so by using the command "npm i" in the terminal.
## Usage
To use my application the user will have to open the terminal, after completing the installion guide above, and type in `npm run build` and then `npm run develop`.
Or the easier option would be to simply navigate to my deployed application link above. Once the application has opened the user can search for books and if they wish to save a book they will need to sign up or login, if they already have an account. Once logged in they will be able to save and delete their already saved books. Thank you for using my app!
